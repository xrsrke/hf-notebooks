    "Certainly! Let's break down and explain the sentence \"For the gradient to a matrix multiplication, the only difference from the forward pass is that the reduction dimension is the output dimension of the forward layer\" in depth. We'll provide a concrete example and step-by-step derivation to make it clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence is discussing the computation of gradients in the context of matrix multiplication during backpropagation in neural networks. Specifically, it highlights that the process of computing the gradient of the loss with respect to the input of a matrix multiplication (i.e., the backward pass) is similar to the forward pass but involves a different dimension for reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward pass of a neural network, a matrix multiplication typically looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Y = X \\cdot W \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( X \\) is the input matrix (shape: \\( n \\times d_{\\text{in}} \\))\n",
    "- \\( W \\) is the weight matrix (shape: \\( d_{\\text{in}} \\times d_{\\text{out}} \\))\n",
    "- \\( Y \\) is the output matrix (shape: \\( n \\times d_{\\text{out}} \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In the backward pass, we compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the input \\( X \\). This involves the chain rule of differentiation. The gradient with respect to \\( X \\) can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\nabla_X \\mathcal{L} = \\nabla_Y \\mathcal{L} \\cdot W^T \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\nabla_Y \\mathcal{L} \\) is the gradient of the loss with respect to the output \\( Y \\) (shape: \\( n \\times d_{\\text{out}} \\))\n",
    "- \\( W^T \\) is the transpose of the weight matrix \\( W \\) (shape: \\( d_{\\text{out}} \\times d_{\\text{in}} \\))\n",
